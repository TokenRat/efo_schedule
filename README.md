# Eurofroence Online 2020 Schedule

If you are participating in the event and see something that is wrong or have additional info, please contact @token on Telegram! PRs are welcome, but I am also happy to include all things that are just sent to me via Telegram.

## Adding media for events

Images should have a decent resolution, but the filesize should be download-friendly! Also provide a `-thumb.jpg` version with 16:9 aspect ratio (e.g. 320*180px resolution).
